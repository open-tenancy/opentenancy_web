  Who We Are

## Who are we?

openTenancy was founded by two ambitious MSc Computer Science graduates from the University of Bristol. Amy completed her LLB before undertaking the MSc and learning to code, while Ana studied Marine Biology. Amy now works at a Legal Tech startup as a Legal Engineer and Ana works as a Graduate Cloud Engineer. We're super excited to be expanding [our team](/team) as well, including with our [contributors](/contribute).

Having been students ourselves and seen the conditions that students typically lived in, and the issues that they let slide because they didn't understand their rights, we decided that more needed to be done and that technology would be the solution for that. openTenancy started as a way to help students learn more about their rights as tenants in the UK. We were tired of having to jump around a number of websites to learn about the treatment we are legally entitled to as tenants. So, we decided to do something about it.

## Why openTenancy?

Because you deserve the chance to enforce your rights as a tenant, and ensure that you get the most out of your tenancy. We believe that the key to a good legal system is one that is open and accessible. Confusing legal terminology, or pages and pages of statutes should not stop someone from learning about what they are legally entitled to.  

We felt that a large part of the law was closed off and unaccessible, meaning that ordinary everyday citizens did not understand their rights due to the inaccessibility of the law. That's part of the reason that we decided to make openTenancy open source as well, because we wanted it to be built by the community based on what the community needed.

## What is open source?

## Is this legal advice?

This document that you receive at the end of our questionnaire, as well as anything else published or produced by openTenancy, is NOT binding legal advice. We are not a registered law firm, and using openTenancy does NOT mean that you have a lawyer nor does this mean that you have a client-solicitor relationship.

Everything from openTenancy is meant to act as guidance as well as relevant signposting to appropriate resources. The main aim of openTenancy is to eliminate the white noise and confusion that other companies have with their excess information, and instead help you get to the bottom of your individual issue. The information produced on our website is intended to be used for research purposes only and to help signpost you to relevant resources, this should not be used as a basis for undertaking any legal action.

## The tech

openTenancy is completely open source and free to use. We are built using Docassemble and GatsbyJS, and run on Netlify.
