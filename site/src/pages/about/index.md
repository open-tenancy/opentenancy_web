  Who We Are

## Who are we?

openTenancy was founded by two ambitious MSc Computer Science graduates from the University of Bristol. Amy completed her LLB before undertaking the MSc and learning to code, while Ana studied Marine Biology. Amy now works at a Legal Tech startup as a Legal Engineer and Ana works as a Graduate Cloud Engineer. We're super excited to be expanding [our team](/team) as well, including with our [contributors](/contribute).

Having been students ourselves and seen the conditions that students typically lived in, and the issues that they let slide because they didn't understand their rights, we decided that more needed to be done and that technology would be the solution for that. openTenancy started as a way to help students learn more about their rights as tenants in the UK. We were tired of having to jump around a number of websites to learn about the treatment we are legally entitled to as tenants. So, we decided to do something about it.

## Why openTenancy?

Because you deserve the chance to enforce your rights as a tenant, and ensure that you get the most out of your tenancy. We believe that the key to a good legal system is one that is open and accessible. Confusing legal terminology, or pages and pages of statutes should not stop someone from learning about what they are legally entitled to.  

We felt that a large part of the law was closed off and unaccessible, meaning that ordinary everyday citizens did not understand their rights due to the inaccessibility of the law. That's part of the reason that we decided to make openTenancy open source as well, because we wanted it to be built by the community based on what the community needed.

## What is open source?
In the programming world, open source is computer software that is produced with open access for users to use and modify the software as they see fit. In some instances, the main version of the code for the software is also actively modified by the community rather than a private organization. This means that you do not have to be an employee to develop a product if its open source.

## How is openTenancy open source?
Our website and the source code for our interviews are all available on [Github](https://github.com/open-tenancy). This means that we're incredibly transparent, everything that you can see on this site you can also see who built it and everything else behind the scenes.

We're also open for [contributions](/contribute) for both the website, directly to our Docassemble interviews, or in the form of flow charts or decision trees to help guide future interviews. We wanted future topics to be created by our users, as they are the individuals that are going to actively benefit from openTenancy.

More than that, we saw a real opportunity to change the way that the law operates. The law, to be honest, has a typically bad reputation. We wanted to create a community instead, and have everyone come together to create something that can benefit hundreds of thousands if not millions of individuals in the UK and potentially around the world.

## How can I get involved?
We love that you want to get involved. Hop on over to our [Contribute page](/contribute) to find out more.


## Is this legal advice?

This document that you receive at the end of our questionnaire, as well as anything else published or produced by openTenancy, is NOT binding legal advice. We are not a registered law firm, and using openTenancy does NOT mean that you have a lawyer nor does this mean that you have a client-solicitor relationship.

Everything from openTenancy is meant to act as guidance as well as relevant signposting to appropriate resources. The main aim of openTenancy is to eliminate the white noise and confusion that other companies have with their excess information, and instead help you get to the bottom of your individual issue. The information produced on our website is intended to be used for research purposes only and to help signpost you to relevant resources, this should not be used as a basis for undertaking any legal action.

## The tech

openTenancy is completely open source and free to use. We are built using Docassemble and GatsbyJS, and run on Netlify.
