heading: Your Tenancy Rights Made Simple. 
description: >-
  We believe that tenancy laws should be made more accessible and clear for everyone, regardless of legal experience. 
  So, we made openTenancy. It is as simple as answering a few questions, at the end of which you will walk away with relevant advice - pointing out the legal basis for the advice, and your suggested next steps. openTenancy is completely free, aimed at ensuring everyone has equal access to enforce their rights.
